### Hi there, I'm [Pengxiang Ding]! üëã.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/about/faculty/201912/t20191206_2513.shtml). Additionally, I am involved in a joint program with [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and am a member of [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/). Currently, I am also a research intern at Alibaba Group. Prior to my Ph.D. career, I received my Msc. Degree from School of Artificial Intelligence, [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2022.

üîç Currently, my research has centered on

* **Multi-modal large models**: multimodal large language models (MLLM), vision-language pre-trained models (VLM)
* **Embodied AI**: foundation models for robotics
* **AIGC**: human motion analysis

I am always looking for related colaboration. If you are interested to chat with me, feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:dingpx2015@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.

<!-- üëØ I am open to:

- cooperation opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type)
- Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested! -->

üí¨ News:

* **[November 29, 2023]** A new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14520) about Cobra, an efficient multi-modal large language model, was released. [Project page](https://sites.google.com/view/cobravlm) has been available. The paper has been featured by [Hugging Face Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers?date=2024-03-22)! Demo will be soon available.
* **[December 9, 2023]** One paper about human motion prediction got accepted for AAAI 2024.
